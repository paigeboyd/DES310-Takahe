# DES310-Takahe
Website created for DES310 Narrative and Storytelling Module.

Used this assignment to experiment with horizontal scrolling, using JS plugins and illustration styles. I wanted to try something completely new including a style I was unfamiliar with. Aim of the website is to have a suitable for kids feel to it.

<h2>2A: HTML Prototype</h2>

<h2>2B: Macro-Interactions</h2>
The final website has changed slightly from some of these prototypes - mainly the addition of a flat-design inspired theme.

<p>Old Idea -</p>
<p> <a href="http://scm.ulster.ac.uk/~B00664007/myworkspace/year2/des310/takahe/findingbird.html">Finding an Extinct New Zealand Bird Webpage</a> The layout for this idea was kept, however the navigation was changed as was the direction the website was going in. The photographs were removed and replaced with illustrations.</p>
